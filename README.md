# Total Recall

*Total Recall* is just a fun memory game... but I couldn't resist tying it in to the Arnold Schwarzenegger film of the same name. Click all of the various Arnies, if you can &mdash; but don't click any of them twice, or the game is over!

## Introduction

*Total Recall* is a full-stack app created using the Create React App (i.e., React and Node.js).

### Playing *Total Recall*
- To begin play, **just click Arnie** as pictured in one of his many films. Boom! You've got a point!
- The images will immediately scramble their order. **Click a second (different) image.** Boom! A second point!
- **Keep clicking images** &mdash; as long you haven't clicked the image before, your score will continue to climb.
- If you _do_ click an image a second time, **the game is over** and your score will start over at zero.
- **Play again and again!** The maximum score is 12.
- The game will keep track of your **personal high score** for the length of the browser session.
